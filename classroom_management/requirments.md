# Classroom Management Tool (Django + FastAPI)

## Problem
Teachers need to manage assignments, grades, and student communication efficiently.

## Solution
A web-based classroom management tool built with:
- **Django** for the web interface.
- **FastAPI** for backend integrations.
- **Postgres** as the database.

---

## Feasibility & Project Success

### 1. Technical Requirements

#### **Django**
- Django is beginner-friendly for web development, especially for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications.
- The models (`Student`, `Assignment`, `Grade`) and views (post assignments, submit grades, student roster) are straightforward to implement.
- Django’s built-in admin panel can help you manage data easily during development.

#### **FastAPI**
- FastAPI is modern and easy to use for building APIs.
- The endpoints (`POST /grades`, `GET /assignments`) are simple to implement, especially with FastAPI’s automatic documentation (Swagger UI).

#### **Database (Postgres)**
- Postgres is a robust choice for relational data. Django integrates seamlessly with Postgres via `psycopg2`.
- The schema (`students`, `assignments`, `grades`) is simple and aligns well with Django’s ORM.

#### **Bonus (Email Notifications)**
- Django has built-in email functionality, and sending notifications for overdue assignments is achievable with Django’s `Celery` or `cron jobs` for scheduling.

### 2. Skill Alignment
- If you’re familiar with Python, Django, and FastAPI, this project is **very manageable**.
- If you’re new to these frameworks, there’s a learning curve, but Django and FastAPI have excellent documentation and tutorials.
- The project doesn’t require advanced algorithms or complex logic, making it accessible for intermediate developers.

### 3. Grade Potential

#### **Core Features**
- Implementing the basic functionality (Django models, views, and FastAPI endpoints) will earn you a **solid grade**.
- Ensure your code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices (e.g., DRY principles, proper error handling).

#### **Bonus Features**
- Adding email notifications for overdue assignments will **boost your grade significantly**. It shows initiative and a deeper understanding of the problem.

#### **UI/UX**
- A clean, functional Django frontend will impress. Use Bootstrap or TailwindCSS for a polished look.

#### **Testing**
- Write unit tests for your Django views and FastAPI endpoints. Testing is often overlooked but can set your project apart.

## Key Considerations

### **Authentication & Authorization**
- Teachers, students, and parents will need different access levels. Use Django’s built-in authentication system or a library like `django-allauth`.

### **CSV Upload (FastAPI)**
- Use Python’s `csv` module or `pandas` to handle bulk uploads. Validate the CSV format before processing.

### **Parent Portal (FastAPI)**
- Ensure the `GET /assignments` endpoint is secure and only accessible to authorized parents.

### **Database Design**
- Keep the schema simple but scalable. For example:
  ```python
  class Student(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
      email = models.EmailField()

  class Assignment(models.Model):
      title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
      due_date = models.DateTimeField()
      student = models.ForeignKey(Student, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

  class Grade(models.Model):
      assignment = models.ForeignKey(Assignment, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
      score = models.FloatField()
